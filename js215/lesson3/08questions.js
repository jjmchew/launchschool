Problem 1 Questions ('kth distinct string')
- assume k is NOT zero-based - i.e., first distinct string is 1, 2nd distinct string is 2
- case sensitive?
- treat all characters (incl. special characters) as characters, i.e., don't ignore spaces, special chars, etc.?
- deal w/ input validation?
    - (empty input array?)
    - # of arguments?
    - incorrect arguments?
    - integer is 0? negative?
    - sparse arrays?
- empty strings?
- max length of strings?
- max # of elements in array?


Problem 2 Questions ('3rd largest number')
- input validation?
  - array not given
  - non-integer elements (incl. sparse array)?
  - numbers could include: 0, negatives, infinity?, NaN?
- ignore numbers that are the same?
  - i.e., same number given multiple times
- can the numbers be ordered without using 'sort' function?
- does input element order matter?


Problem 3 Questions ('prime numbers in a substring')
- assume 'numbers' in a substring are the LONGEST substring of consecutive digits present in a string?
  - i.e, '13' is `13` and not `1` and `3`
- input validation?
  - only strings given?
  - empty strings?
  - 'negative' numbers?
  - correct # of arguments?
- treat special characters like any other character (i.e, non-digit) - serve as delimiters
- largest possible size of primes?  is performance a concern?
- largest possible string? (i.e., can parse entire string using split or need something with N(1)?)


Problem 4 Questions ('')
- input validation?
  - only arrays?
  - how to treat (non-array) objects?
  - further nested arrays possible?
  - no arguments?
  - too many arguments?
  - potential for special numbers? (e.g., Infinity, NaN, -0, etc.)
  - spare arrays?
  - only index-elements?  i.e., how to treat non-element keys?
  - what makes objects identical?  (i.e., same key-value pairs?)
